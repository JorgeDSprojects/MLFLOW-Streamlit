# Wind Turbine Energy Model Prediction
![Gits architecture](pic/wind-energy-programs.png)
## 1. Project Overview

Proper management of wind turbine fields has a key factor that it is the prediction of energy. 
This allows us to manage the different resources in these fields and to use them correctly in relation to grid demand and other energy sources.

We have a dataset of last year's records from a wind turbine, with five variables. 
A timestamp every ten minutes.
Information about the power generated, actual and theorical and last the wind speed and direction.


## 2. Project Highlights

In Wind Turbines, Scada Systems measure and save data's like wind speed, wind direction, generated power etc. for 10 minutes intervals. This file was taken from a wind turbine's scada system that is working and generating power in Turkey.

The data's in the file are:

+ Date/Time (for 10 minutes intervals)
<br>
+ Theoretical_Power_Curve (KWh): The theoretical power values that the turbine generates with that wind speed which is given by the turbine manufacturer
+ LV ActivePower (kW): The power generated by the turbine for that moment
<br>
+ Wind Speed (m/s): The wind speed at the hub height of the turbine (the wind speed that turbine use for electricity generation)
+ Wind Direction (Â°): The wind direction at the hub height of the turbine (wind turbines turn to this direction automaticly)


## 3. EDA

## 4. Questions:
+ If there is one record every ten minutes, that is 6 per hour. There are 2030 records missing, is that important?
